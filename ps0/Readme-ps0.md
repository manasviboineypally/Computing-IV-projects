## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

The point I want to discuss about is 2nd point, 
The use of unauthorised materials, fabricated data or web based sources and social media without an instructors permission is considered unethical by institutions. It breaches the learning procedure and in turn leads to missinformation, biased outcomes or academic deceit. It disrespects the standard of research and scholarship.
  If a student is willing to utilize such resourses must always take proper permission so that academic integrity may be maintained. The consequences for voilating such guidelines are severe.
