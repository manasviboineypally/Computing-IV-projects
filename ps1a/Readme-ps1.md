## Description
Explain what the project does.
Here is the code for the linear Feedback shift register which you can see in the PDF above. Here is my Implementation I made the code using string variables and provided me input (tap_positions were integer values which explained where the values are XOR'd )using string manipulation how to build up on this, so our answer can be obtained.

### Features

Describe the representation you used and why you did things that way as well as any other interesting design decisions you made.

#### Part a

To do this I just used the Boost generate to get a hold on test cases that were present in the required tests. If OpenBracket should be implemented in its own class. cpp, I have included only 4 test cases to check my code implementation.

#### Part b

### Issues

What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

I mean, I think that I've done my part and it seems to be working well for the teacher's implementation.

### Tests

Write Xml for describing the fields to be tested in ur Boost unit tests.

The code should return the values of each test are when you XOR the tap positions with: The complete inputs provided by the code

### Extra Credit

Anything special you did. Must do this to get Bouns Points

I will cut straight to the chase, there was nothing fancy that i have added in this implementation.

I used YouTube for making me understand LFSR concepts, Quora for all the error problems I have got and solved, Class Material provided to us by Dr. Shobha Sir in Berzerk for learning linting and many of the requirement we require for our class.
