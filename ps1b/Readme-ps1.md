## Description
    The PhotoMagic project in PS1b entails encrypting and decrypting digital images through the use of an LFSR. In this lab assignment, i was supposed to implement a transform function, by modifying images in such a way that it would XOR the pixel values (red, green, blue components) with the bits generated by the LFSR. The work involves loading images, applying transformations to them, and then displaying the results with the help of the SFML library. The final program should take a LFSR seed provided via command line arguments and do both encryption and decryption. EXTRA CREDIT: Convert alphanumeric passwords to binary seeds.

### Issues
    No Issues.

### Features
    1.To encrypt a given image using a Linear feedback shift register.
    Using the FibLFSR class and generate() function in order to return an integer unique to the original seed and tap point that specified.
    2.Then this integer with rgb values of each pixel in the source image, I used to run an XOR operation to produce a pixel that is encrypted or decrypted based on the original image. Then added the Alphanumeric Values to Encrypt and Decrypt the input file.
    3.By using the command ./PhotoMagic input-file.png output-file.png <seed>, we get the out where the encryption is done in the image. And the encryption behaviour as follows:
    The transform function performs the encryption on the image through the lfsr object. An encryption based on LFSR would just XOR the pixel values of the image with bits generated from the LFSR. It changes every pixel's RGB value to encode the image into actually scrambling it into the encrypted version.
    4.By using the command ./PhotoMagic output-file.png input-file.png <seed>, we get the out where the decryption is done in the image. And the decryption behaviour as follows:
    Since the LFSR encryption is symmetric, the very same seed, BSeed, and LFSR would work to decrypt the image because reapplying the very same transform function with the very same seed should revert the encrypted image back to its original form since XORing the pixel values twice with the same random sequence restores the original values.

### Tests

    1.BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(testGenerateInstr):
    This test is verifying the correctness of the generate method in the FibLFSR class. More precisely:
    It initializes the LFSR with a given 16-bit seed.
    It then fills up 9 bits from the LFSR.
    The test assumes that these 9 bits, when decoded as a decimal number is 51.

    2.BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(testStepCase5):
    This seeds the LFSR with "1011100101001100".
    Each call to step() likely does the following:
    Based on the current state of the register, calculates a new bit.
    Shifts the register one place.
    Returns the new calculated bit.
    The test seems to expect step() to return 1 first called, 0 second called and 1 third and fourth called.

    3.BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(testGenerateCase3):
    The LFSR is seeded with the string "0001110001110001".
    The call to generate(9) probably is doing something like this:
    It performs 9 steps of the LFSR algorithm.
    Collects the 9 bits resulting from these operations.
    Returns these 9 bits as an integer value.
    The test assumes these 9 bits, as a decimal number, are equal to 0.


### Extra Credit
    Added the extra credit by including the Alphanumeric values to Encrypt and Decrypt the input-file.png.
    The following command is to Encrypt and Decrypt the input-file.png:
    ./PhotoMagic input-file.png output-file.png <Alphanumeric Value>
    This code converts an alphanumeric LFSR seed to a binary string with the help of the seedToBinary() function. Here's how it works:
    Loop through every character of the seed: For every character in the string lfsrSeed, it converts that character to its 8-bit binary representation by using std::bitset<8>. 
    Combine binary values into one: Appends a binary representation of each character to form a binary seed string.
    Trim/Pad length to 16 bits: If longer than 16 bits, it truncates it; if shorter, it pads it with leading zeros.
    This binary string then initializes the LFSR.
